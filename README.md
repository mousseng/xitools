# xitools
a collection of addons (and maybe some plugins) for Ashita v4 that I made.

## addons
- `xitools` is a suite of UI replacement components, check its README for details
- `recast` is a fork of `recast` that has been imgui-fied
- `skillchain` tracks active and potential skillchains and magic bursts
- `rcheck` makes it easy to check party/alliance readiness by asking and doing
  the tallying for you
- `minimap-helper` auto-configures the zoom for your Minimap plugin
- `tracker` is a primitive ability tracker tailored for the author
- `logger` logs some simple packet data for diagnostic and dev purposes

## config
these are my ashitacast configs. perhaps you'll find them useful; mostly i just
want them under source control with the rest of my ashita stuff.

## scripts
scripts i may or may not use, and that you may or may not find useful.
